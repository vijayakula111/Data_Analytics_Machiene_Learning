## What is a record?

In the DataVec world a Record represents a single entry in a dataset. DataVec differentiates types of records to make data manipulation easier with built-in APIs. Sequences and 2D records are distinguishable.

## Using records

Most of the time you do not need to interact with the record classes directly, unless you are manually iterating records for the purpose of forwarding through a neural network.
