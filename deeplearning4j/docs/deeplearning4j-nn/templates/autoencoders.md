## What are autoencoders?

Autoencoders are neural networks for unsupervised learning. Eclipse Deeplearning4j supports certain autoencoder layers such as variational autoencoders.

## Where's Restricted Boltzmann Machine?

RBMs are no longer supported as of version 0.9.x. They are no longer best-in-class for most machine learning problems.
